    <!--In this section, you will learn how to layouting your element in HTML-->
    <!--You need to remember that, I really not recommend to use table for layouting. But for to understand
    Layouting in HTML, I only will teach how to use it.-->

    <!--WITHOUT LAYOUT-->

    <!--WITH LAYOUT-->
    <!--We will add the layout with 1 rows and 2 columns-->
    <h1>WITH TABLE</h1>

    <h3>Example 1</h3>
    <table style="width: 100%;"> <!--Add style properties in "table" tag to set how big the table will be-->
        <tr> <!--This "tr" tag will create the row that you need. If you need more row just add more "tr"-->
            <td style="width: 50%;"> <!--Every "td" tag will create one column inside the table-->
