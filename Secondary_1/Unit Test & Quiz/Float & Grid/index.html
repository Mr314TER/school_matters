                <p><strong>BBC</strong> â€” A new AI-generated virtual news presenter named Fedha has been introduced by Kuwait News, a Kuwaiti media outlet. Fedha's debut appearance was on Kuwait News' Twitter account, where she appears as an image of a woman wearing a black jacket and white T-shirt with light-colored hair. According to Abdullah Boftain, the deputy editor-in-chief for Kuwait News, the creation of Fedha tested AI's potential to offer new and innovative content. In the future, Fedha may develop to have a Kuwaiti accent and read online news bulletins.

                    Boftain explained that Fedha's name refers to silver, which is a popular and old Kuwaiti name. He also mentioned that the presenter's blonde hair and light-colored eyes represent Kuwait's diverse population of Kuwaitis and expatriates. It is not the first time that an AI-generated news presenter has been introduced, as China's state news agency unveiled its own virtual newsreader in 2018.

                    According to a report by Goldman Sachs, AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs, which may lead to a quarter of work tasks being taken over by technology in the US and Europe. However, the report also suggests that this could lead to new job opportunities and a productivity boom.
