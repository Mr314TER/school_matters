                Customers to be warned of energy bill rises from April
            </h3>

                <strong>(BBC)</strong> - Customers will soon get letters from energy companies warning them that their bills will increase at the beginning of April. According to Citizens Advice, businesses are required to provide customers sufficient notice of price increases or other changes that would negatively affect them. The average annual household energy cost is expected to increase to £3,000 starting next month. According to the BBC, the government is evaluating the amount of energy assistance it provides to households amid concerns that many more could run into problems. It follows Grant Shapps, the secretary of energy, declaring that he was "quite sympathetic" to the notion that the government needed to halt the increase in yearly energy costs.

                The government is now capping the average household bill at £2,500 per year, plus a £400 winter rebate, which will also expire in April. Nevertheless, beginning April 1, the assistance will be reduced, causing bills to rise. Energy UK, which represents providers, said firms would write to clients in the coming days to let them know how much their bills would rise. It stated that suppliers may help consumers who were having difficulty paying their bills, but there was a "limit" to what they could do.

                <strong>A budget U-Turn?</strong>

                According to fuel poverty activists, the number of homes struggling to pay their bills could jump from 6.7 million to 8.4 million as a result of the April increase. So far, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has refused to extend his backing, but experts believe he may reconsider, most likely during this month's Spring Budget on March 15. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), the Government can afford to extend support at present levels through the summer because wholesale energy costs have decreased considerably, lowering the cost of the plan. Most analysts also predict that energy bills will decrease below £2,500 per year by July, implying that the government would only need to give support until then.

                Others, such as the Resolution Foundation think tank and consumer rights activist Martin Lewis, believe Mr Hunt is quite likely to cancel the bill increase. Energy UK encouraged the government to hold the level of support at £2,500 for an average home, "and to declare it immediately so it can be incorporated in consumer bills in time for April". The Treasury Department declined to comment.
